Each blog post must explore its subject in depth with engaging, thought-provoking questions, fascinating facts, and practical insights. The tone should be authoritative yet conversational, ensuring the articles resonate with the target audience. Use rich, vivid, and descriptive language throughout to captivate readers from start to finish.

For each blog post, generate a JSON object with the following keys:
- "id": A unique identifier created by converting the title to a lowercase, hyphen-separated string.
- "title": Exactly as provided.
- "image": An image URL placeholder in the format "assets/[id].jpg".
- "summary": A one-sentence engaging overview that captures the essence of the article.
- "content": A comprehensive HTML-formatted article that exceeds 2000 words. The content must:
    - Be thoroughly researched and factually accurate.
    - Incorporate relevant SEO keywords or phrases naturally to optimize for search engines.
    - Use rich, descriptive, and vivid language to maintain reader interest.
    - Include multiple sections and subheadings to break down the topic into digestible parts.
    - Feature bold headings using `<strong>` tags.
    - Use paragraph breaks with `<p>` tags and additional spacing with `<br>` tags as needed.
    - Pose curiosity-driven questions and provide practical insights, real-life examples, and, where appropriate, reference reputable sources with links to enhance credibility.
    - Reference visual elements (e.g., infographics, charts) if available, to break up large blocks of text.
    - Ensure clear transitions between sections for smooth flow and logical progression.
    - Be carefully proofread for clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy, ensuring the final content is high-quality and error-free.
