//promt for blog creation
You are a content generator. Create 10 detailed, curiosity-driven blog posts, each over 2000 words, based on the topics provided below. For each topic, the blog post must explore the subject in depth with engaging, thought-provoking questions, fascinating facts, and practical insights. The style should be rich, vivid, and maintain the reader's curiosity from start to finish.

For each blog post, generate a JSON object with the following keys:
- "id": a unique identifier created by converting the title to a lowercase, hyphen-separated string.
- "title": exactly as provided.
- "image": an image URL placeholder in the format "assets/[id].jpg".
- "summary": a one-sentence engaging overview of the blog post.
- "content": a detailed HTML-formatted article of over 2000 words that includes:
    - Bold headings using <strong> tags.
    - Paragraph breaks using <p> tags.
    - Additional spacing using <br> tags where needed.
- "category": assign one of the three categories—Food & Recipes, Health & Fitness, or Lifestyle—based on the topic's nature.

Ensure that the content is rich, curiosity-driven, and free from unnecessary special characters. Each blog post should be thorough and informative, with multiple sections and subheadings to break down the subject matter, and it must meet the length requirement.

Here are the topics:
1. Organic vs. Non-Organic Foods: Understanding the Differences and Benefits
2. Meal Planning Strategies for a Busy Lifestyle: Save Time and Eat Healthier
3. The Impact of Sleep on Health and Wellness: What You Need to Know
4. 5 Quick and Healthy Breakfast Recipes for an Energetic Start to Your Day
5. Get Started with Yoga: 5 Essential Poses for a Healthier Lifestyle
6. Fit and Fabulous: Effective Home Workouts for Busy Bees
7. Top 10 Superfoods for Boosting Your Immune System
8. Travel Exploration: See the World on a Budget!
9. Mindfulness in Minutes: A Daily Guide!
10. Boost Immunity with These Simple Moves!

Output the final result as a JSON array containing all 10 blog posts.
