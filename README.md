promt for blog creation


You are a content generator. Create 10 detailed, curiosity-driven blog posts, each of over 2000 words, based on the list of topics provided below. Each blog post should explore its subject in depth, engaging the reader with thought-provoking questions, fascinating facts, and practical insights.

For each topic, generate a blog post that is output as a JSON object. Each JSON object must contain the following keys: "id", "title", "image", "summary", "content", and "category". The "content" field must be HTML-formatted text and include:
- Bold headings using <strong> tags
- Paragraph breaks using <p> tags
- Additional spacing where needed using <br> tags

Remove any unnecessary special characters. Ensure the content is engaging, curiosity-driven, and meets the length requirement of 2000+ words.

The final output should be a JSON array with all 10 blog posts.

Here are the topics:
1. Organic vs. Non-Organic Foods: Understanding the Differences and Benefits
2. Meal Planning Strategies for a Busy Lifestyle: Save Time and Eat Healthier
3. The Impact of Sleep on Health and Wellness: What You Need to Know
4. 5 Quick and Healthy Breakfast Recipes for an Energetic Start to Your Day
5. Get Started with Yoga: 5 Essential Poses for a Healthier Lifestyle
6. Fit and Fabulous: Effective Home Workouts for Busy Bees
7. Top 10 Superfoods for Boosting Your Immune System
8. Travel Exploration: See the World on a Budget!
9. Mindfulness in Minutes: A Daily Guide!
10. Boost Immunity with These Simple Moves!

For each blog post, generate:
- A unique "id" (a lowercase, hyphen-separated string based on the title)
- A "title" (exactly as provided)
- An "image" URL (you can use a placeholder like "assets/[id].jpg")
- A "summary" (a one-sentence engaging overview of the blog post)
- "content" (the full HTML-formatted article with 2000+ words, with bold headings, paragraphs, and extra line spacing)
- A "category" (choose a category like "Health & Fitness", "Wellness", or "Lifestyle" as appropriate for the topic)

Output the final JSON array containing the 10 blog posts.
